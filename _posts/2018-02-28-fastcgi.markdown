# How to understand FastCGI

For example, you(PHP) are going to talk buiness with Esikimo...

You(PHP) speak Chinese(PHP code), but the Eskimo(WebServer, like Apache/Nginx and so forth) speek Eskimo(Great C language).

That's the problem must be solved.
OK, fine. Let's talk buiness on universal English(FastCGI protocol).

### How do PHP transform php-code?
About that, PHP has a module called **PHP-FPM**, you need to make sure the module is on your operation system, if not, please install it with below command:

> yum install php-fpm

### How do Webserver transform C language?
Don't worry about this issue, almost all the webservers themselves have the translator responsible for transforming C language to FastCGI protocol.

### Notice
Only the Linux use the PHP-FPM module which is newer than PHP-CGI, Windows System still use the old one.
They have the same function.

As a Linux operator, of course, I will use PHP-FPM module.
